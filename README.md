Amazon Cognito with AWS Amplify


## Setting up AWS services    
If you do not have your AWS services already created, follow these steps. If you already have your services set up, just configure your aws-exports.js file.    

1. from the root of the project, create awsmobile project    

```
awsmobile init
```

2. add user sign-in / authentication (Amazon Cognito)    

```
awsmobile user-signin enable
```

3. push new services to console    

```
awsmobile push
```
